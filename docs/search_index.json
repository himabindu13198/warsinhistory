Take extra care to clean up your graphs, ensuring that best practices for presentation are followed, as described in the audience ready style section below. 5.1 War Types In the first place, we are interested in what types of wars happened most frequently in that the original data sets are divided into 4 types: intra-state, inter-state, extra-state, and non-state wars. It is observed from Figure 1 that there are most intra-state wars with number over 400, and then inter-state wars, extra-state wars with non-state wars are the least. Considering that the scale of inter-state wars is usually larger than scale of intra-state wars, the larger number of intra-state wars is expected and non-state wars are not very common with least occurences. In addition, according to Figure 2 and definitions of wars types, we found that: Within extra-state wars, there are two thrids of extra-state wars are imperial and one third of extra-state wars are colonial. All inter-state wars only have one type as inter-state. More than hald of the intra-state wars are civil wars for central control, while 40% are civil wars for local issues. In terms of the remaining intr-state wars, there are approximately twice intercommunal wars as regional internal wars. Among all non-state wars, the majority wars happened in non-state territories while little were cross state borders (actually there was one). "],
["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Select one (or more) of your key findings to present in an interactive format. Be selective in the choices that you present to the user; the idea is that in 5-10 minutes, users should have a good sense of the question(s) that you are interested in and the trends you’ve identified in the data. In other words, they should understand the value of the analysis, be it business value, scientific value, general knowledge, etc. Interactive graphs must follow all of the best practices as with static graphs in terms of perception, labeling, accuracy, etc. You may choose the tool (D3, Shiny, or other) The complexity of your tool will be taken into account: we expect more complexity from a higher-level tool like Shiny than a lower-level tool like D3, which requires you to build a lot from scratch. Make sure that the user is clear on what the tool does and how to use it. It may be possible to include the interactive component directly in your report. If not, publish your graph somewhere on the web and provide a link in your report in the interactive section. The obvious choices are blockbuilder.org to create a block for D3, and shinyapps.io for Shiny apps but other options are fine. You are encouraged to share experiences on Piazza to help classmates with the publishing process. Note: the interactive component is worth approximately 25% of the final project grade. Therefore, do not spend 90% of your time on it… concentrate on the exploratory data analysis piece. "],
