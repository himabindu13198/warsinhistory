# Interactive component

Select one (or more) of your key findings to present in an interactive format. Be selective in the choices that you present to the user; the idea is that in 5-10 minutes, users should have a good sense of the question(s) that you are interested in and the trends you’ve identified in the data. In other words, they should understand the value of the analysis, be it business value, scientific value, general knowledge, etc.

Interactive graphs must follow all of the best practices as with static graphs in terms of perception, labeling, accuracy, etc.

You may choose the tool (D3, Shiny, or other) The complexity of your tool will be taken into account: we expect more complexity from a higher-level tool like Shiny than a lower-level tool like D3, which requires you to build a lot from scratch.

Make sure that the user is clear on what the tool does and how to use it.

It may be possible to include the interactive component directly in your report. If not, publish your graph somewhere on the web and provide a link in your report in the interactive section. The obvious choices are blockbuilder.org to create a block for D3, and shinyapps.io for Shiny apps but other options are fine. You are encouraged to share experiences on Piazza to help classmates with the publishing process.

Note: the interactive component is worth approximately 25% of the final project grade. Therefore, do not spend 90% of your time on it… concentrate on the exploratory data analysis piece.
