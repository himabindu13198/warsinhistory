Visualization:

To better understand or obtain insights such as which countries were most active in the wars and with whom, we plotted the wars (World War 1 and World War 2) in a graphical manner. Each node in the graph represents a country which was a part of the war being visualized and each edge represents the fact that those two countries which are connected to the edge on either end, were involved in a war against each other. 

Usage of the app: The drop-down menu enables users to select if they want to visualize the countries involved in World War 1 or in World War 2. Once selected, the app graphically visualizes the countries. On clicking on a country, the countries it was involved in a war with, get highlighted and hence one can visually see the number of countries that were against and also which countries these were. The nodes are reorderable and can be moved on the screen. There is also an option to zoom in and out of the image for better visibility and inspection by the user. 

The theme of the app was changed from default to 'united' for better aesthetics.
