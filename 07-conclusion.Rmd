# Conclusion

Discuss limitations and future directions, lessons learned.

Here are our most surprising findings:

- France initiated the most inter-state wars (8 wars), while U.S., Russia and Japan initiated the second most inter-state wars (7 wars).

- France, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy changed sides once during WW1.

- From the interactive parallel coordinate plot, we observed that while states that were not initiators of the wars tend to have lower battle deaths, USSR in WW2 did not follow that tread: even though it wasn't an initiator, it had the highest battle deaths in all countries. 

- Population for Japan increased steadily even during the two world wars and remained increasing even after those wars. 

- During WW1, primary school enrollment in Germany was unaffected and had been increasing steadily.  

As was discussed in the data section, there is limitation in all of our datasets.
